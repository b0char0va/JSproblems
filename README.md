001 Check for Palindromes<br/>
002 Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. <br/>
003 Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).<br/>
004 Repeat a given string (first argument) num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. <br/>
005 Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ... ending. Note that inserting the three dots to the end will add to the string length. However, if the given maximum string length num is less than or equal to 3, then the addition of the three dots does not add to the string length in determining the truncated string. <br/>
006 Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.<br/>
007 Return the remaining elements of an array after chopping off n elements from the head.<br/>
008 Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.<br/>
009 Remove all falsy values from an array. Falsy values in JavaScript are false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN.<br/>
010 Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.<br/>
011 Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The returned value should be a number.<br/>
012 Caesar cipher-ROT13-All letters are shifted by 13 places, return the decoded string. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on. All letters will be in uppercase.<br/>
013 Sum all numbers in range <br/>
014 Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.<br/>
015 Perform a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and return the new sentence. Preserve the case of the original word when you are replacing it. <br/>
016 Translate the provided string to pig latin. Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an "ay". If a word begins with a vowel you just add "way" to the end. <br/>
017 The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character, get its pair, and return the results as a 2d array. Base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. Match the missing element to the provided character. Return the provided character as the first element in each array. For example, for the input GCG, return [["G", "C"], ["C","G"],["G", "C"]] <br/>
018 Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it. <br/>
019 Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive. Return true or false.<br/>
020 Convert the characters &, <, >, " (double quote), and ' (apostrophe), in a string to their corresponding HTML entities. <br/>
021 Convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes. Input may include camelcase, underscores, spaces.<br/>
022 Create a function that looks through an array (first argument) and returns the first element in the array that passes a truth test (second argument). <br/>
023 Drop the elements of an array (first argument), starting from the front, until the predicate (second argument) returns true. <br/>
024 Return an English translated sentence of the passed binary string. The binary string will be space separated. <br/>
025 Check if the predicate (second argument) is truthy on all elements of a collection (first argument).<br/>
026 Create a function that sums two arguments together. If only one argument is provided, then return a function that expects one argument and returns the sum. <br/>
