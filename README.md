001 Check for Palindromes<br/>
002 Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. <br/>
003 Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).<br/>
004 Repeat a given string (first argument) num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. <br/>
005 Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ... ending. Note that inserting the three dots to the end will add to the string length. However, if the given maximum string length num is less than or equal to 3, then the addition of the three dots does not add to the string length in determining the truncated string. <br/>
006 Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.<br/>
