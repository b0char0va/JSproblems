001 Check for Palindromes<br/>
002 Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. <br/>
003 Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).<br/>
004 Repeat a given string (first argument) num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. <br/>
005 Truncate a string (first argument) if it is longer than the given maximum string length (second argument). Return the truncated string with a ... ending. Note that inserting the three dots to the end will add to the string length. However, if the given maximum string length num is less than or equal to 3, then the addition of the three dots does not add to the string length in determining the truncated string. <br/>
006 Write a function that splits an array (first argument) into groups the length of size (second argument) and returns them as a two-dimensional array.<br/>
007 Return the remaining elements of an array after chopping off n elements from the head.<br/>
008 Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.<br/>
009 Remove all falsy values from an array. Falsy values in JavaScript are false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN.<br/>
010 Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.<br/>
011 Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The returned value should be a number.<br/>
012 Caesar cipher-ROT13-All letters are shifted by 13 places, return the decoded string. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on. All letters will be in uppercase.
